## üìÜ‚úÖFuture Plan
- **Agent Mechanism**: Adding an agent mechanism allows long sequence tasks to be well divided.

- **Feedback Channel from External Functions**: We plan to add a feedback mechanism for the robot to receive information from external functions. This would significantly assist model-based decision-making processes.

- **Navigation Interface**: A new interface for robot navigation is also in the pipeline. It will enable the utilization of this framework in navigation-oriented tasks.
